# Classification Project

This repository contains a classification project utilizing a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The project encompasses various stages including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Preprocessing, and Visualization. 

## Overview

- **Data Exploration**: 
  - Conducted comprehensive EDA, including data preprocessing and visualization.
- **Modeling**: 
  - Prepared the data for machine learning and trained multiple models, such as Decision Tree Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, XGBoost, CatBoost, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN).
- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Evaluated the performance of each model and compared their results.
- **Deployment**:
  - Developed a web-based application using Streamlit for easy access to the analysis results.
